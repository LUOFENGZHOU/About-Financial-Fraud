SEC Charges Delphi Corporation and Nine Individuals, Including Former CEO, CFO, Treasurer and Controller, in Wide-Ranging Financial Fraud; Four Others Charged with Aiding and Abetting Related Violations; Delphi and Six Individuals Settle
The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled financial fraud charges in federal court in Detroit against Delphi Corporation, a Troy, Mich. auto parts supplier. In its complaint, the Commission charges Delphi with engaging in a pattern of fraudulent conduct between 2000 and 2004. The Commission also charges thirteen individuals for their alleged roles in the fraudulent conduct and/or in related reporting and books-and-records violations by Delphi.
The complaint charges seven former Delphi employees and two others with participating in or aiding and abetting Delphi's fraud.
The complaint also charges four individuals with aiding and abetting Delphi's reporting and books-and-records violations.
The Commission's complaint alleges that, between 2000 and 2004, Delphi engaged in multiple schemes that resulted in Delphi materially misstating its financial condition and operating results in filings with the Commission, offering documents, press releases, and other documents and statements. The allegations include the following.
Delphi simultaneously settled the charges, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder.
The Commission simultaneously settled with six individuals, who also neither admitted nor denied the Commission's allegations.
Each of the settlements is subject to court approval, and Delphi's settlement is also subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing Delphi's bankruptcy.
The Commission's complaint alleges that the non-settling defendants Battenberg, Free, Blahnik, Belans, Rozanski, Kudla and McDonald violated and/or aided and abetted Delphi's violations of the federal securities laws as follows:
As to all of the non-settling defendants, the complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of these provisions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks officer-and-director bars against Battenberg and Blahnik.
The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation in this investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The Commission's investigation is continuing.
