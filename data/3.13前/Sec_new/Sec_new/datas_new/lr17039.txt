The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") announced today that Arthur Andersen LLP and three of its current and former partners settled a civil injunctive action, charging violations of antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as related administrative proceedings brought pursuant to rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice ("rule 102(e)"). In a related action, a fourth Andersen partner, a regional practice director, settled administrative proceedings brought pursuant to rule 102(e) in which the Commission found that he engaged in improper professional conduct. These proceedings arise out of one or more of Andersen's audits of Waste Management, Inc.'s ("Waste Management" or the "Company") financial statements during the period 1992 through 1996.
Andersen and the individual defendants and respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations or findings in the Commission's Complaint and orders, consented to the following sanctions:

The Commission alleged in its Complaint, or found in its Orders, as follows:
Andersen
. . . .
We disagree with management's netting of the gains and charges and the lack of disclosures. We have communicated strongly to WMX management that this is an area of SEC exposure. We will continue to monitor this trend, and assess in all cases the impact of non-disclosure in terms of materiality to the overall financial statement presentation and effect on current year earnings.
Allgyer
Maier

The Commission's investigation is continuing as to others.
