Securities And Exchange Commission v. Edward A. Heil and R. Bret Jenkins Civil Action No. CV 05 5852 (United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York) (Judge Hurley)
Securities And Exchange Commission v. eSafetyWorld, Inc. (now known as EZ Auctions and Shipping Inc.) and Raymond Burghard, Civil Action No. CV 05 5851 (United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York) (Judge Hurley)
On December 15, 2005, the SEC filed two civil injunctive actions in federal district court for the Eastern District of New York related to fraudulent schemes perpetrated at eSafetyWorld, Inc. (now known as EZ Auctions and Shipping Inc.) ("eSafety").
The first complaint alleges that Edward A. Heil and R. Bret Jenkins, respectively eSafety's CEO and CFO at the relevant time, engaged in fraudulent schemes in 2001 involving a false press release, financial fraud, and/or a market manipulation. The complaint alleges that:
Heil and Jenkins each have agreed to settle the complaint by consenting, on a neither admit nor deny basis, to the entry of an injunction based on the anti-fraud, books and records, internal controls and electronic signature provisions of the federal securities laws. Heil's injunction is based on violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and his aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20, and 12b-25 thereunder, and Section 232.302 of Regulation S-T. Jenkins' injunction is based on violations of Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act; and his aiding and abetting violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13a-13, 12b-20, 12b-25, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and Section 232.302 of Regulation S-T. They each also agreed to a 10-year officer and director bar. Heil will pay a penalty of $60,000 and Jenkins will pay a penalty of $50,000.
In a separate but related action, Heil has offered to settle an administrative proceeding pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice by accepting a bar from practicing before the Commission as an accountant with a right to request reinstatement in five years.
In the second federal court action, the Commission alleges that eSafety engaged in each of the fraudulent schemes described above, and that Raymond Burghard aided and abetted eSafety's financial fraud by signing a false loan agreement and a false loan confirmation that he knew would be provided to eSafety's auditors. In so doing, the Commission alleges that Burghard aided and abetted violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.
The Commission seeks injunctive relief and penalties from eSafety and Burghard.
