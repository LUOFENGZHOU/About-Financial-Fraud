Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3466 / June 27, 2013
Securities and Exchange Commission v. JBI, Inc., John Bordynuik and Ronald Baldwin, Jr., Civil Action No. C.A. No. 1:12-cv-10012 (District of Massachusetts, Complaint filed January 4, 2012)
Court Enters Final Judgments Against JBI, Inc. and Former Officer in Accounting Fraud Case
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that a Massachusetts federal court entered final judgments by consent on June 26, 2013 and March 20, 2013, respectively, against John W. Bordynuik (“Bordynuik”) and JBI, Inc. (“JBI”), two defendants in a fraud action filed by the Commission in 2012.  The Commission alleged in its complaint that JBI, its then CEO, John Bordynuik, and its former CFO, Ronald Baldwin, Jr. (“Baldwin”), engaged in a scheme to commit securities and accounting fraud in 2009.  In the consent judgments, the Court ordered JBI to pay $150,000 and Bordynuik to pay $110,000 in civil monetary penalties.
The Commission filed its action on January 4, 2012, alleging that during two reporting periods in 2009 and in contravention of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), JBI stated materially false and inaccurate financial information on its financial statements.  The Complaint alleged that the defendants misrepresented and overstated the actual value of certain assets, known as media credits, by almost 1,000%, in an effort to bolster its balance sheet.  JBI then used the overvalued financial statements in two private capital raising efforts (Private Investment in Public Equity or PIPES) that raised over $8.4 million from unwitting investors in these PIPES just before the company issued a public statement indicating its financial statements could no longer be relied upon, in part, due to the erroneous valuation of the media credits and other assets on the balance sheet.  According to the complaint, Bordynuik was aware of, or was reckless in not being aware of, GAAP concerns surrounding the reported value of the media credits in advance of the company’s periodic reports that included the financial statements filed with the Commission, yet falsely certified that the company’s financial statements for those reporting periods were filed in conformity with GAAP. 
Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint, JBI and Bordynuik consented to final judgments entered by the Court.  The final judgment against JBI permanently enjoined the company from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and ordered JBI to pay a civil monetary penalty of $150,000.  The final judgment against Bordynuik permanently enjoined him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $110,000.  Bordynuik also was barred for five years (from March 18, 2013) from acting as an officer or director of a public company.  The case against the remaining defendant (Baldwin) remains pending.
