Litigation Release No. 18058 / April 1, 2003 Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1747 / April 1, 2003
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Thomas & Betts Corporation, et al., No. 1:03CV00784 (Lamberth, J.) (D.D.C.)
SEC Files Settled Accounting Charges against Thomas & Betts Corporation and Three Individuals
On April 1, 2003, the Commission filed a settled accounting case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Thomas & Betts Corporation ("T&B"), a publicly-traded electrical components manufacturer headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, and three individuals. The individual defendants are Neil W. Parker, former President of T&B's Electrical Components Group, Robin B. Gregersen, former Vice President and Controller of T&B's Electrical Components Group, and Robert C. Calhoun, former Vice President of T&B's National Accounts Sales Group and current Vice President of T&B's Distributor Marketing. The Commission charged Parker and Gregersen with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the Commission's rules thereunder, and charged all of the defendants with violating, or aiding and abetting violations of, the reporting, books-and-records, and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act and the Commission's rules thereunder.
The Commission's complaint alleges that, from late 1998 through early 2000, officers at T&B's Electrical Components Group  specifically defendants Parker, Gregersen, and Calhoun  knowingly engaged in conduct that circumvented T&B's internal controls and falsified T&B's books, records, and accounts. As a result, the complaint further alleges, T&B materially overstated its pre-tax income in earnings releases and in public filings with the Commission. In March 2001, according to the complaint, T&B restated its 1999 fiscal year financial statements, including the interim quarters, to materially reduce its previously reported pre-tax income.
In particular, the Commission's complaint alleges that:
Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, all of the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments against them. T&B agreed to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.
Parker agreed to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. Parker also agreed to be prohibited from acting as an officer or director of any public company, to pay a total of $62,384, comprised of $9,741 in disgorgement, $2,643 in prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.
Gregersen agreed to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-2. Gregersen also agreed to pay a total of $31,535, comprised of $13,769 in disgorgement, $2,766 in prejudgment interest, and a $15,000 civil penalty, the amount of which was based, in part, on Gregersen's demonstrated inability to pay more than that.
Calhoun agreed to be enjoined from violating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, and 13b2-2. Calhoun also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.
