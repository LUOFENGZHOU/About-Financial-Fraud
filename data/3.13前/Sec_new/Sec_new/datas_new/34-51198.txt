ORDER INSTITUTING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND RULE 102(e) OF THE COMMISSION'S RULES OF PRACTICE, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate that public cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against FFP Marketing Company, Inc. ("FFP") and Warner Williams ("Williams"), pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Craig Scott, CPA ("Scott"), pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.1
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, FFP, Williams and Scott (collectively "Respondents") have submitted an Offer of Settlement (the "Offer") which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-And-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-And-Desist Order ("Order"), as set forth below.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents' Offer, the Commission finds that:
1. FFP Marketing Company, Inc., a Texas corporation headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, owns a subsidiary (FFP Operating Partners, L.P.) that operates convenience stores with gas stations in eleven states throughout the south, central and southwestern United States. (The subsidiary operated the convenience stores from 1987 to 1998, while it was owned by FFP's predecessor.) FFP's common stock was registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") beginning in January of 1998. On November 11, 2002, the Commission issued an order granting FFP's application, pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 12d2-2(d) thereunder, to withdraw from listing on the AMEX and from registration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. On November 13, 2002, FFP filed a Form 15 with the Commission to terminate its registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to suspend its duty to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act on the basis that it had fewer than 300 record holders of its common shares. FFP Operating Partners, L.P. filed for bankruptcy protection on October 23, 2003.
2. Craig Scott, age 57, is a resident of McKinney, Texas and was, until October 2003, the chief financial officer and general counsel of FFP. In this capacity, Scott's responsibilities included the preparation of all Commission filings. Scott is licensed to practice law in Texas. He is also licensed as a CPA in Texas.
3. Warner Williams, age 48, is a resident of North Richland Hills, Texas and was employed as the controller of FFP and its predecessors. As controller, Williams supervised the entire accounting department and reported directly to Scott. In 2002, FFP reassigned Williams to the position of President of a different wholly owned FFP subsidiary (Direct Fuels, L.P.), which was sold in 2003. Williams is not a CPA.
The audit of the Company's book[s] and records for 2001 has not yet been completed at this date. At the present time, the company estimates that it incurred a net loss of approximately $4,000,000 in 2001, compared to net income of $723,000 in 2000. Principal reasons for the anticipated change in 2001, compared to 2000, include but are not limited to the following: a decrease in gross margin on retail sales of motor fuels (primarily from increased competition and an inability of the Company to pass on increased fuel costs at its retail locations), a decrease in gross margin on sales of merchandise and a decrease in direct store expense at Company-operated stores (primarily resulting from the sale/conversion of Company-operated convenience stores to gas-only stores), an increase in general and administrative costs (primarily from additional payroll costs and legal expenses), and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense (primarily from additional amortization of loan costs). The foregoing estimates are subject to audit adjustment.
Although the Company has recently executed two management contracts to manage approximately 120 convenience stores for third parties, the benefits of such management contracts will not begin to be realized in the financial results of the Company until 2002.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that:  
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents' Offer.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that:
A. FFP shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 12b-25, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
B. Williams shall cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
C. Scott shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and shall cease and desist from causing any violations and any future violations of Rules 12b-20 and 12b-25 under the Exchange Act.
D. Scott is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney or as an accountant.
E. After 3 years from the date of this order, Scott may request that the Commission consider his reinstatement as an accountant by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1. a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review, of any public company's financial statements that are filed with the Commission. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that Scott's work in his practice before the Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or
2. an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that:
F. The Commission will consider an application by Scott to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant provided that his state CPA license is current and he has resolved any other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy. However, if state licensure is dependant on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission's review may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Scott's character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.
G. After 3 years, before appearing and resuming practice before the Commission as an attorney, Scott will submit an affidavit to the Commission's Office of the General Counsel truthfully stating, under penalty of perjury, that he has complied with the Commission's Order, that he is not subject to any suspension or disbarment as an attorney by a court of the United States or of any state, territory, district, commonwealth, or possession, and that he has not been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude as set forth in Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.
By the Commission.
Jonathan G. Katz Secretary
1 Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part: "The Commission may deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before it to any person who is found�to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules or regulations thereunder."
