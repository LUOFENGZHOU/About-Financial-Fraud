Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1599 / July 24, 2002
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Adelphia Communications Corporation, John J. Rigas, Timothy J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, James P. Rigas, James R. Brown, and Michael C. Mulcahey, 02 Civ. 5776 (KW) (S.D.N.Y.)
The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging major cable television provider Adelphia Communications Corporation; its founder John J. Rigas; his three sons, Timothy J. Rigas, Michael J. Rigas, and James P. Rigas; and two senior executives at Adelphia, James R. Brown and Michael C. Mulcahey, in one of the most extensive financial frauds ever to take place at a public company. In its complaint, the Commission charges that Adelphia, at the direction of the individual defendants: (1) fraudulently excluded billions of dollars in liabilities from its consolidated financial statements by hiding them in off-balance sheet affiliates; (2) falsified operations statistics and inflated Adelphia's earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations; and (3) concealed rampant self-dealing by the Rigas Family, including the undisclosed use of corporate funds for Rigas Family stock purchases and the acquisition of luxury condominiums in New York and elsewhere.
The Commission seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to account for and disgorge all ill-gotten gains including  as to the individuals  all compensation received during the fraud, all property unlawfully taken from Adelphia through undisclosed related-party transactions, and any severance payments related to their resignations from the company. The Commission also seeks civil penalties from each defendant, and permanent injunctions from violating the securities laws. The Commission further seeks an order barring each of the individual defendants from acting as an officer or director of a public company.
