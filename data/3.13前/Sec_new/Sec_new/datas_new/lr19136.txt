The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Joseph P. Nacchio, former co-chairman and chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International Inc., and eight other former Qwest officers and employees with fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws. In three separate but related civil actions, the Commission alleges that, between 1999 and 2002, the Qwest defendants engaged in a multi-faceted fraudulent scheme designed to mislead the investing public about the company's revenue and growth. In addition to Nacchio, the Commission's complaints name former chief financial officers Robert S. Woodruff and Robin R. Szeliga, former chief operating officer Afshin Mohebbi, former executive vice president of wholesale markets Gregory M. Casey, former senior vice president of pricing and offer management Roger B. Hoaglund, former senior vice president of finance William L. Eveleth, former director of financial reporting James J. Kozlowski, and former senior manager of financial reporting Frank T. Noyes. The complaints seek injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all of the defendants, and officer/director bars against Nacchio, Woodruff, Szeliga, Mohebbi, Casey, and Eveleth. Hoaglund and Eveleth both consented to the entry of judgments against them without admitting or denying the allegations against them in the complaints.
Hoaglund consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; enjoining him from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13; and directing him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and disgorgement of $200,000 plus prejudgment interest. Eveleth consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; enjoining him from aiding and abetting any violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13; directing him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000 and disgorgement of $35,575 plus prejudgment interest; and prohibiting him from acting as an officer or director of any public company for five years. The judgment also resolves the Commission's allegations against Eveleth in a previously filed civil action, SEC v. Arnold, et al., CV-03-Z-0328 (OES) (D. Colo.).
According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Nacchio and others made numerous false and misleading statements about Qwest's financial condition in annual, quarterly, and current reports, in registration statements that incorporated Qwest's financial statements, and in other public statements, including earnings releases and investor calls. As a result of that scheme, Qwest fraudulently recognized over $3 billion of revenue and excluded $71.3 million in expenses. The Commission, in October 2004, sued Qwest in a settled injunctive action in which the company agreed to pay a $250 million penalty for its misconduct.
The Commission's complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, allege as follows:
In Commission filings and other public statements, Nacchio, Woodruff, and Szeliga fraudulently characterized nonrecurring revenue from indefeasible rights of use ("IRUs") and equipment transactions as recurring "data and Internet service revenues," thereby masking Qwest's declining financial condition and artificially inflating its stock price. Qwest used such nonrecurring revenue to fill the gap between actual and projected revenue. Over time, in fact, Qwest's dependence on such one-time transactions grew to the point that it was likened internally to an "addiction" and the nonrecurring IRU and equipment sale transactions were likened to "heroin." Among other things, the Qwest executives' misrepresentations about Qwest's revenue sources allowed Qwest to maintain a stock price sufficiently high to complete its pending merger with US West, Inc.
The complaints allege that, as a result of the above conduct, the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Sections 10(b) and13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1; and aided and abetted Qwest's violations of Sections13(a) and 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13; Nacchio, Woodruff, Szeliga, Mohebbi and Casey violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2; and Mohebbi and Casey aided and abetted Qwest's violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.
On March 15, 2005, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and filed related civil actions for penalties against Mark A. Schumacher and Brian K. Treadway, former controllers at Qwest (Litigation Release Nos. 19134 and 19135; Sec. Exch. Act. Rel. Nos. 34-51373 and 34-51375).
On March 15, 2005, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings against Jennifer J. Black, a former director of finance at Qwest (Sec. Exch. Act. Rel. No. 34-51374).
In October 2004, the Commission filed a settled civil action against Qwest Communications International Inc. (Litigation Release No. 18936).
In July 2004, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Michael Felicissimo, the former CFO of Qwest's wireless division (Litigation Release No. 18800).
In June 2004, the Commission instituted settled cease-and-desist proceedings and filed related civil actions for penalties against Augustine M. Cruciotti, a former Qwest executive vice president, and Steven L. Haggerty, a former Qwest senior vice president (Litigation Release Nos. 18754 and 18755).
In September 2003, the Commission instituted a settled cease-and-desist proceeding and filed a related civil action for penalties against Loren D. Pfau, a former Qwest sales manager (Litigation Release No. 18374).
In February 2003, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against former Qwest officers Joel M. Arnold, William L. Eveleth, Grant Graham, Thomas W. Hall, Douglas K. Hutchins, Bryan K. Treadway, John M. Walker, and Richard L. Weston (Litigation Release No. 17996).
